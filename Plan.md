1. **Dashboard** - Overview of the entire platform, including recent activity, key metrics, and quick insights.
2. **Users** - Management of all users, including vendors, customers, and other admins. Capabilities typically include creating, editing, deleting, and viewing user profiles.
3. **Vendors** - Specific section for managing vendor accounts. This could include approval processes, status updates, and detailed vendor information.
4. **Products/Services** - Overview and management of all the listings on the platform, possibly categorized by type (e.g., hotel rooms, restaurant menus).
5. **Orders** - Management and tracking of orders or bookings made through the platform. This could include processing refunds or disputes.
6. **Reviews** - Moderation of reviews left by customers. This might include flagging inappropriate content or responding to feedback.
7. **Payments** - Overview of the financial transactions within the platform, including vendor payouts, customer refunds, and overall revenue.
8. **Reports** - Generation of detailed reports on sales, user activity, demographic data, and other analytics.
9. **Marketing** - Tools and settings for managing marketing efforts such as email campaigns, discount codes, and featured listings.
