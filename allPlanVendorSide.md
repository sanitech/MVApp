Since you have finished the sidebar setup for the vendor dashboard, the next logical step would be to work on specific functionalities based on the vendor type. Hereâ€™s a general outline of what you can do next:

1. **Dashboard Overview**:
   - Display an overview of vendor stats (number of products/services, reservations, sales, etc.).

2. **Menu Management**:
   - Implement functionality to add, update, and delete menu items or services (depending on vendor type).

3. **Room Management (for hotels)**:
   - Create forms for adding, updating, or deleting rooms.
   - Include room-specific features like amenities, pricing, availability, and reservation status.

4. **Orders/Reservations**:
   - Implement an order or reservation management feature where vendors can track incoming bookings or orders.

5. **Ratings & Reviews**:
   - Display customer ratings and reviews for the vendor's products/services and rooms.

6. **Gallery Management**:
   - Allow vendors to upload and manage images, such as room photos for hotels or product photos for restaurants.

7. **Promotions & Discounts**:
   - Allow vendors to create and manage promotions or discount offers.

8. **Profile Settings**:
   - Implement vendor profile settings where they can manage their business information (name, address, social media links, etc.).

You can prioritize based on the vendor's specific needs and gradually build out these features.
